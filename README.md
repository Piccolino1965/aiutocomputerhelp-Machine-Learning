Machine Learning
Well, as the crazy person I am, Iâ€™ve decided to create this practical and progressive journey into Machine Learning with Python. The goal of this new series is to illustrate the concepts from the basics to the development of advanced models, aiming to explain each topic as clearly as possible (within my knowledge), always accompanied by practical Python code examples. This journey is designed both for those approaching machine learning for the first time and for those who prefer an application-driven approach.

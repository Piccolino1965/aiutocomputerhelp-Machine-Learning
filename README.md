Machine Learning
Well, as the crazy person I am, I’ve decided to create this practical and progressive journey into Machine Learning with Python. The goal of this new series is to illustrate the concepts from the basics to the development of advanced models, aiming to explain each topic as clearly as possible (within my knowledge), always accompanied by practical Python code examples. This journey is designed both for those approaching machine learning for the first time and for those who prefer an application-driven approach.
I will try to present various concepts and techniques of machine learning by covering the following key steps:
We will start with essential definitions and an overview of machine learning applications in everyday life. I will show you how to set up your Python work environment with fundamental libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others.
I will explore different types of algorithms and models, starting from simple techniques like linear regression to more advanced technologies such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers (which is why I say I’m crazy).
Additionally, I will demonstrate how to use tools like matplotlib to visually represent data and model results, allowing you to better understand their behavior.
Finally, we will tackle practical problems such as image classification, tabular data analysis, text processing, and more, helping you develop transferable skills.
